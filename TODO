Things that need to be done (highest priority first?):

Get input from user
  + Use scanf(), gets() or something similar
  + No need to parse yet. Just read into a buffer

Read game file
  + You can for instance use fopen() and fread()
  + No need to parse yet. Just read into a buffer

Make a demo game file
  + Base it on the 'example_gameplay' file
  + Use JSON or create a simple custom format
  + It doesn't need to be complete. A sketch is fine.

Separate engine functionality in different files
  + For instance: filereading.c, inputparsing.c, ...

Think about how we'll implements game functions
  + For instance the "look" command

Make datastructures to hold game entities
  + Make it very simple
  + Don't work farther than development of the demo game file
